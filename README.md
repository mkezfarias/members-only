<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Rails allows us to build complex apps with databases using merely a few lines of code. By understanding Active records, we can easly create and manipulate data and even store it in the database without actually writing any SQL commands.

----
This is the first collaborative project on the "Ruby on Rails" path from the Microverse FullStack web developer curriculum

Starting date December 10th 2019
Send to Code Review December 10th 2019
